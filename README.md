# End to End ML Project

### **Problem statement:** _Predict student marks_

> During this project the efforts were made to pick a generic problem statement and more focus was provided to create a proper template which is as per industry standards. This is achieved by creating directories like:

1. artifacts
2. logs
3. Src
   - Components
   - Pipeline
4. Templates

---

Along with this standard .py files were also created for **Data handling** : [data_ingestion, data_transformation], **Model_trainer**, exception handling, logger, utils, predict_pipeline, train_pipeline, requirements, setup, **App deployment**.
